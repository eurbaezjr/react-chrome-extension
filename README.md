Chrome Extension boilerplate with React
---
## Please note
Assumes you are familiar with create-react-app (CRA) and building Chrome Extensions

## What does this boilerplate do?
Provides a clean boilerplate for building fully custom Chrome Extensions using React. Leveraging CRA's 'asset-manifest.json', the Chrome background.js script can inject a React Chrome Extension into any webpage (or tab) WITHOUT ejecting CRA, changing package.json, adding customizations to webpack, etc, etc. Just a simple clean reliable boilerplate that works without customizing CRA.
